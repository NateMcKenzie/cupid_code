# Cupid Code

## Description
Cupid Code is a unique dating app that uses AI to help nerds find love. 
Daters can create a profile and answer questions about their interests and hobbies. 
They can chat with the AI to get advice on how to improve their dating skills. 
They will bring their own date.
When the date starts the AI will ask if it can listen in on the conversation.
If the AI determines that the date is going well, it will do nothing. But if the date is going bad then the AI will take over and try to save the date.
The AI may call in a Cupid (a gig worker) to bring flowers or chocolates to the table.
The AI may buy movie tickets or make dinner reservations and email them to the dater.
The Dater will set a budget for the date so the AI can provide assistance during the date while staying within the budget.

Cupid Code is a web app that uses Vue.js for the front end and Django for the back end.
