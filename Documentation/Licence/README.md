From Nate S:

I know I should have asked before I did this, but I was curious how one would go about adding a license to a project. 
It was cool to see how it's done, and I assume the process for even a proprietary license would be similar.
I'll leave it up to the legal team to decide what license to use, but I wanted to see what the process was like.
