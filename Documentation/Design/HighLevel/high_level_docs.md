# **Security Considerations**

* Encryption of Sensitive Information
    * All sensitive information, including login credentials for users (Daters, Cupids, Managers), will undergo encryption using the SHA-256 algorithm before being stored in the database. This encrypted data will be decrypted only at the time of login, with the implementation facilitated by available Django and Node modules. Which data is sensitive is described below.
* Secure Handling of Chat Logs
    * Chat logs between Daters and the AI will be safeguarded by individualized access-keys, stored via cookies. This approach ensures that each user can access their chat logs without the need for repeated entry of access-keys, enhancing both security and user convenience.
* Location Privacy
    * The location of a Dater will remain exclusively visible to them until a date crisis occurs. At such a time, an anonymous ping will be sent to nearby Cupids who have accepted the mission. Once accepted, Cupids will receive the live location of the user along with their profile picture for identification purposes.
* Financial Transactions
    * Credit/debit card transactions will be facilitated while adhering to PCI compliance standards. Card information, including numbers, expiration dates, and CVV codes, will be encrypted before transmission over the internet to ensure robust financial data security.
* Frameworks and APIs
    * Utilization of the latest frameworks will be prioritized, and any obsolete features will be addressed proactively. APIs with a strong reputation for security will be preferred to enhance overall application security measures.
* Account Protection
    * A secure login system will be implemented, incorporating strong password requirements, favoring 12+ characters or 8+ characters with a mix of symbols, numbers, and capital letters. The exploration of a timeout system will be approached cautiously to avoid inconveniences during user activity. Consideration will be given to integrating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an additional layer of security.
* Data Flow
    * Data flow will be encrypted using HTTPS, with specific attention given to framework capabilities. Utilization of AES for symmetric encryption and RSA for asymmetric encryption will be explored. User access to data will be restricted, providing Cupids with limited access for matchmaking purposes, while management retains broader access. Secure Session IDs and CSRF tokens will be implemented, and comprehensive tracking of data flow will be logged and stored.
* Database Security
    * Password hashing within the database, regular data backups, and exploration of data encryption beyond passwords, utilizing AES/RSA for optimum protection, will be priorities in maintaining the security and resilience of the database.

* Compliance and Regulatory Considerations
    * Certain industries and regions have stringent compliance and regulatory requirements regarding data handling and storage. Hosting the server locally enables us to adhere more closely to these regulations, ensuring that our application remains in full compliance with industry-specific standards and legal frameworks.

In conclusion, the decision to host our server on local machines is a result of a comprehensive assessment that prioritizes cost-effectiveness, stringent data security, and the ability to tailor the environment to meet the specific needs of our client. This approach reflects our commitment to delivering a reliable, secure, and customizable solution that aligns seamlessly with the client's objectives and concerns.

### **Client**

Our system prioritizes user flexibility by accepting requests from a wide array of Operating Systems and User-Agents. Whether users prefer iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, or various Linux Distros, and choose Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc. as their preferred User-Agent, our platform is equipped to seamlessly accommodate their preferences.

The linchpin enabling this versatility is the implementation of HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS plays a pivotal role in ensuring a secure and reliable connection between the Cupid code and our clients. This encryption protocol encrypts the data exchanged between the client and server, safeguarding it from potential threats or unauthorized access.

The use of HTTPS not only provides a secure communication channel, but also enhances the overall stability of connections. It establishes trust between the server and client, mitigating the risk of data interception or manipulation during transit. This commitment to security is fundamental in our approach, allowing users to engage with the Cupid code confidently, regardless of their chosen combination of Operating System and User-Agent.

It's worth noting that as long as users' chosen combination of User-Agent and Operating System supports HTTPS and JavaScript, our application will function seamlessly. This ensures a robust and reliable experience, reinforcing our dedication to providing a secure environment for all users.

**Software Stack Decision**

The team extensively deliberated on the merits of various frontend and backend options available for the project. Given our constrained development timeline, it is imperative to adopt a development stack that facilitates rapid learning and building. We want a stack that not only prioritizes swift development, but also ensures inherent security, enabling us to focus more on the application itself. Additionally, we are eager to explore novel technologies and enhance our skill set.

Navigating this decision proved challenging, as each developer on the team had prior experience with either frontend or backend frameworks. Considering these parameters, we reached a consensus to employ Vue.js for the frontend and Django for the backend. While some team members are familiar with these technologies, we view this familiarity as an opportunity to delve deeper and acquire new insights, thereby broadening our expertise within these frameworks.

# **Software Architecture**

Cupid Code will comprise many architectures due to how large it’ll be. The backend will need to be written in modules and classes so it is easy to send data to and from the front end and the database. The frontend will require us to follow the model of event driven programming. Our application will follow the architecture of event driven programming by rendering the pages and sending data to the backend. However, the frontend can also follow a similar modular approach to reduce repeated code.

Since the system as a whole will be composed of three pieces: user interface, processing backend, and a database. We will follow the Client-Server 3-Tier architecture. Notably, we will prioritize a thin client configuration to alleviate backend workload, particularly given the extensive interaction with AI functionalities.

Combining these three architectures will allow us to utilize the best parts of each portion of our system, as well as make it easy to update and maintain the system in the future. This comprehensive approach ensures robustness, scalability, and efficiency throughout Cupid Code's development and deployment phases, promising a seamless user experience and facilitating future enhancements and adaptations as needed.

# **User Interface**

To access Cupid Code, Daters, Cupids, and Managers can utilize any device with a web browser and an internet connection. Given that Daters and Cupids are likely to be mobile users, we prioritize optimizing the user interface for mobile devices such as phones. For Managers who may predominantly operate from desktop or laptop computers, the interface will be tailored to suit that environment. Nonetheless, we are committed to ensuring universal access to Cupid Code across all devices and platforms by designing interfaces that are visually appealing on both large and small screens.

The report function will allow the user to look at statistics from a previous period of time and allow them to customize it and print it off/export as a PDF.

**Login System Design Purpose**

Modularization in software development is an approach that entails breaking down a project into smaller, manageable components. This method facilitates a comprehensive understanding of how each piece functions, and how each piece integrates with others. By isolating each module, developers gain clarity in the development process, making it easier to write, test, and debug code without risking the integrity of the entire system.

Moreover, modularization significantly contributes to the future sustainability of the project.

Modular design simplifies the addition of new features, updates to existing ones, and any debugging that will appear over the project's lifecycle. This structured approach ensures that modifications can be implemented efficiently without causing disruptions to the overall system, ultimately contributing to the longevity and scalability of the software.

By utilizing these concepts and principles, we can break Cupid Code into multiple components, display what each one does, and how they’ll work with one another. This approach is necessary to use our limited development time as efficiently as possible. This approach also allows us as developers to simultaneously code and test multiple parts of the project before gluing them together and delivering a viable product to the customer. It is not only important to code the product like this, but to design it like so as well. This allows us to look at the big picture of the project before coding and make it easier to split up the tasks evenly. It will also allow for others to update the docs without contradicting much of anything else because every piece is isolated enough that the only thing each piece needs to have written down is how it works and how it’s connected. Utilizing this concept throughout the entire process of developing Cupid Code will help us avoid massive time crunches, make updating documentation quick and easy, and get an MVP delivered on time.

# **External Interfaces**

### **Considered APIs**

* AI API (Microsoft Copilot)
* Location API (Geolocation)
* Speech To Text API (pyttsx3)
* Text and Email notifications API (Twilio) 
* Nearby Shops API (yelpapi)

### **How to deal with so many APIs**

* Modular Code Design
    * Identify specific areas in our code where external functionality is required. Utilize APIs only in these specific modules or components, keeping the rest of our codebase isolated from external dependencies.
    * By compartmentalizing API usage, we make it easier to manage updates, fixes, or replacements. If an API changes or becomes obsolete, we’ll only need to modify the relevant sections of your code, rather than the entire codebase.
    * Implement clear interfaces or abstraction layers between the code and the APIs we're using. This abstraction shields the code from direct dependencies on API specifics, making it easier to swap out one API for another if needed.
* Documentation Management
    * Keep comprehensive documentation not only of the APIs in use but also any customizations, workarounds, or fixes we’ve implemented to deal with outdated or incorrect API documentation.
    * Document the specific issues encountered with the APIs, such as outdated or incorrect documentation, and provide detailed explanations of how we would resolve these issues within the code.
    * Maintain this documentation alongside our codebase, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with any changes or updates to the APIs we’re integrating.
    * Regularly review and update the documentation to reflect any changes in API usage, ensuring that developers working on the project have accurate information.

By following these strategies, we can effectively manage the challenges of implementing APIs in the code, ensuring modularity, flexibility, and clarity in the development process.
