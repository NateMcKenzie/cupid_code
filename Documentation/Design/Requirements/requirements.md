**Problem Statement**

Dating  poses challenges due to the high stakes of forming a romantic relationship  with someone unfamiliar. There are many social pitfalls to fall into, and often, people find that there is little outside help available. This difficulty is especially pronounced for computer scientists and "nerd" types, who already have a reputation for struggling with interpersonal relationships. There  is a need for a solution that addresses these common dating hurdles by providing tailored support for individuals in this demographic, enhancing their ability to form meaningful connections.

**Solution Statement**

Preparing for a date can be intimidating, and it can be tough to know what to say or how to act. Cupid Code is a revolutionary dating assistance platform that utilizes artificial intelligence to help individuals through that process. Cupid Code supplies the user with an artificial intelligence (AI) partner that the user can ask questions and get tips for the date. It can even listen in on the conversation and provide immediate assistance when it senses trouble. If a planned activity falls through, then the AI can pay for an item or service and call for a “Cupid”, a hired assistant, to deliver it right to you during the date.
