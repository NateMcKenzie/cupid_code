## Overview

Cupid Code is a web application that allows users to create Dater or Cupid accounts. 
A Dater is a user who is looking for help with dating. 
A Cupid is a user who is willing to help others with dating. 
Cupids are gig workers that get paid for helping.

## Dater

Daters will create a profile and answer questions about themselves. 
Once they have done this they will be able to create talk to an AI chatbot that will help them do well on their planned dates.
They will also be able to create calendar events for their dates and see a list of all their past and upcoming dates.
While on a date they will be able to use the chatbot to help them with conversation topics.
They can allow the app to listen to their conversation and the AI will analyze the conversation and request a cupid's help if needed.

## Cupid

Cupids will set up bank information and create a profile.
They will be able to see a list of all the gigs that are available in the area and accept them.
Once they have accepted a gig they will be given details about the gig.
A gig can consist of a few different things such as picking up flowers, writing a poem, playing a song, or even picking up the tab.
Once they have completed the gig they will be paid and the dater will be able to rate them.
The cupid will also be able to rate the dater.

## Manager

Managers are a special type of user that can see all the data in the system.
They can see all the users, all the gigs, and all the ratings.
