## Dater Demo
**Use Cases**
- Create a new customer account and set up a dating profile
- Chat with the AI dating expert (about an upcoming date or for general dating advice)
    - Note: You might need to wait a second for the AI to "wake up". It always takes a second on the first message of the day.
