## Introduction

Welcome to Cupid Code! This manual serves as a guide for new Cupids joining Cupid Code for the first time. Within this manual, you will learn what a Cupid does, how to create and login to your account, and how to use the Cupid Code app to earn money and help save awkward daters. 

To begin, what is a Cupid? Just like the name implies, Cupids for Cupid Code serve as little gods of love dispatched to help daters using Cupid Code have successful dates. If ever a date is going bad, a Gig is created to be picked up by Cupids in the area. This Gig is a simple item pickup request to help a date go more smoothly. These pickup requests will range from something as simple as flowers or chocolate to things such as movie tickets. As a Cupid, you will be accepting these Gigs, picking up the requested item, and delivering it to the date. Afterwards you'll have an option to rate the dater you serviced and (most importantly) get paid for what you do.
