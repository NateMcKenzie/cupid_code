## Introduction

Welcome to Cupid Code! This manual serves as a guide for new Cupids joining Cupid Code for the first time. Within this manual, you will learn what a Cupid does, how to create and login to your account, and how to use the Cupid Code app to earn money and help save awkward daters. 

To begin, what is a Cupid? Just like the name implies, Cupids for Cupid Code serve as little gods of love dispatched to help daters using Cupid Code have successful dates. If ever a date is going bad, a Gig is created to be picked up by Cupids in the area. This Gig is a simple item pickup request to help a date go more smoothly. These pickup requests will range from something as simple as flowers or chocolate to things such as movie tickets. As a Cupid, you will be accepting these Gigs, picking up the requested item, and delivering it to the date. Afterwards you'll have an option to rate the dater you serviced and (most importantly) get paid for what you do.

#### Editing your Profile
To edit your profile, simply edit the text fields with what edits you'd like to make and click "Save". 

#### Going Online
To go online, click the big coin at the top of the page with a heart and arrow. If this coin is White, this indicates that you are currently online. If it is dark blue, you are offline. The example page above demonstrates an online profile. 


### Feedback Page

This page will contain information about feedback users have given about services you've provided. Here a simple average rating out of five is displayed for you.

#### Claiming a Gig

Under the "Available" section of the Gigs Page, various Gigs in your area will be listed and can be claimed. To claim a Gig, simply click the pink "Claim" button located within the blue box containing the information about a given Gig. This will transfer the Gig to Active portion of this page. 

#### Dropping a Gig

If you have claimed a Gig, but for some reason are unable to complete it simply click the "Drop" button located on the active Gig. This will unassign it from your profile and allow it to be claimed again by you or other Cupids in the area. 

#### Completeing a Gig

Once you've completed a Gig by picking up the requested items and delivered them to the specified location, you can now complete the Gig. This is done by clicking the "Complete" button located on an active Gig. 

### Past Gigs Page

Once you've completed a Gig, it will be moved to this page. This gives you a record of past work you've completed as well as allows to you rate daters that you serviced.

#### Rating a Dater

To rate a dater, find the Gig associtated with the dater you serviced in the Past Gigs page. You'll then click on the "Rate Dater" button which will allow you to give the dater a score out of five as well as leave any comments, compliments, or concerns you've had. Feel free to be honest as you need to be with these reviews as only managers of Cupid Code will see these reviews.

## Common Issues

- When rating a dater, the hearts are not contained in the rating box. 
    - This is a known bug, however it does not affect your ability to rate a date. Simply use this as normal and a patch will be out soon to fix this! 

## FAQ

- How are gigs created? 
    - Gigs are created by either the app's AI or by daters needing help on their date. 
- I don't know how to use coordinates. How do I find where I need to deliver the item? 
    - Unfortunetly at this time non-coordinate locations are not available through our site. If you find it difficult to use these for deliveries we recommend using gps-coordinates.net or any other navigation systems to find where items need to be delivered. 
- You don't require banking information when signing up to be a Cupid. How am I supposed to get paid? 
    - You don't, but this "feature" will be coming soon!
