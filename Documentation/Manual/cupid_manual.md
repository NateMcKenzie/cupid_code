## Introduction

Welcome to Cupid Code! 
This manual is your guide to joining Cupid Code as a new Cupid. 
Here, you'll learn about your role, how to create and log into your account, and how to use the Cupid Code app to earn money by saving awkward daters.

So, what is a Cupid? Just like the name implies, Cupids for Cupid Code are like little gods of love sent to help daters using our platform have successful dates. 
If a date is going south, a Gig is created for Cupids in the area. These Gigs are simple item pickup requests to help the date go more smoothly. You might be asked to pick up anything from flowers to movie tickets. 
Your job is to accept these Gigs, pick up the requested item, and deliver it to the date. 
Then, you can rate the dater you serviced and, most importantly, get paid for your efforts.

#### Rating a Dater

To rate a dater, find the Gig associated with them and click the "Rate Dater" button. You can give them a score out of five and leave any comments needed to explain the rating. 

Keep in mind that while ratings are anonymous, daters you rate can see the rating they've received. As such, we ask that you be mindful of the dater you are rating and provide feedback in a constructive and respectful manner.

## Common Issues

- When rating a dater, the hearts are not contained in the rating box. 
    - This is a known bug that does not affect your ability to rate a date. A fix will be released soon. 

## FAQ

- How are gigs created? 
    - Gigs are created by either the app's AI or by daters needing help on their date. 
- I don't know how to use coordinates. How do I find where I need to deliver the item? 
    - Currently, non-coordinate locations are not supported. We recommend using navigation systems like gps-coordinates.net for deliveries.
- You don't require banking information when signing up to be a Cupid. How am I supposed to get paid? 
    - We are working on adding this feature soon!
