## Project Overview

The Dev Team had a lot of fun working on this project.
The team was able to create a fully functional dating app that allows users to create profiles, plan dates, and chat with the AI.
The team used Vue for the front-end, Django for the back-end, and SQLlite for the database. 
The team was able to implement all the features planned for the project, including user authentication, profile creation, and chat functionality. 
The team also implemented a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
Overall, the team is very proud of the work done on this project and is excited to share it with the world.

## Project Management

The project was managed using a Agile methodology. 
The team used the Scrum framework to organize the work into sprints. 
The team met regularly to discuss the progress of the project and to plan the work for the next sprint. 
The team used GitLab to track the progress of the project and to assign tasks to team members. 
The team also used Discord to communicate with each other and to share files and information.

## Sprints

### Sprint 0 (Daniel Barfuss)

#### Summary
We wrote the requirements document. That had several parts to it (the person who worked on the section is indicated in 
paranthesis):
- Problem Statement (Nate McKenzie)
- Solution Statement (Daniel Barfuss)
- Requirements
	-- Functional Requirements (Nate Scott)
	-- Non-Functional Requirements (Nate Scott)
	-- Business Requirements (Nate Scott)
	-- User Requirements (Emma Wright)
	-- MoSCoW (Brighton Ellis), (we had it as it's own section, apart from Functional/Non-Functional). The Functional and Non-Func
		tional sections are more principle-oriented. Then MoSCoW got into more specifics (hopefully without
		going into design mode)
- User Stories (Emma Wright)
- UML Diagram (Eric DeBloois)
- Editing (Brandon Herrin, Daniel Barfuss, Nate McKenzie)

We also met up as a team in person two times throughout this sprint. It was for one hour each meeting.

We set up the repository and got it situated with everyone. We also got a discord channel set up so we can easily
communicate with each other. I believe Brighton was the one who also gave us a file that helps with Git stuff like 
merging, which is nice. 

#### Goals
* Finish the requirements document.
* Establish a channel of communication to make discussions and interaction easy.

#### Accomplishments
We completed the requirements document. We got an effective means for the team to communicate and collaborate.

#### Setbacks
There weren't any. Perhaps a little difficulty reaching Brandon, but that was it. 

#### Lessons Learned
Requirement-seeking can be a demanding challenge. It's difficult to foresee everything, and we can get optimistic. However, it can serve as a way to push ourselves. We started on the right foot.

#### Retrospective
Some slight changes to the requirements documentation was needed over time. Part of it was clarification that we needed to put in. For the most part, I was proud with the level of detail.

### Sprint 1 (Nate Stott)

#### Summary

We set up the project repository and started working on the high and low level design documents.
We had three weeks to complete the design documents, and we were able to get them done in time.
During this sprint, we broke down the project into smaller tasks and assigned them to team members.
We also broke team members into smaller groups to work on specific parts of the project.
These smaller groups met regularly to discuss the progress of the project and to plan the work for the next sprint.
Groups included the front-end team, the back-end team, and the middleend team.
Someone being a part of a group did not mean that they could not work on other parts of the project.
In a lot of cases, team members worked on multiple parts of the project in different groups.
Someone being assigned to a group just meant that they were responsible for that part of the project.
We also created a timeline for the project and set goals for each sprint.
Overall, this sprint was a success, and we were excited to move on to the next sprint.

- Groups
  - Front-end
    - Brighton Ellis
    - Eric Deboolis
  - Back-end
    - Nate Stott
    - Nate McKenzie
    - Daniel Barfuss
  - Middleend
    - Emma Wright 

- Group responsibilities
  - Front-end
    - Design the user interface
    - Create the front-end components
    - Implement the front-end functionality
  - Back-end
    - Design the database
    - Create the back-end components
    - Implement the back-end functionality
  - Middleend
    - Connect the front-end and back-end
    - Implement the middleend functionality

#### Goals

We had three goals for this sprint:
1. Complete the high-level design document
2. Complete the low-level design document
3. Create a timeline for the project

#### Accomplishments

We were able to complete all three goals for this sprint.
The high level design document was completed on time and was approved by the team.
The low level design document was also completed on time and was approved by the team.
We were also able to create a timeline for the project and set goals for each sprint.

#### Setbacks

We had to shift group members around to ensure every group had enough people to complete the tasks.

#### Lessons Learned

We learned that it is important to break the project down into smaller tasks.
This makes it easier to assign tasks to team members and to track the progress of the project.
It also allows parts of the project to be switched out for new ideas without affecting the whole project.
A high and low level design document are important to have before starting the project.

#### Retrospective

We felt this sprint was a success, but it was challenging to get the high and low level design documents done in time.
With so many ideas, and possible features, it was hard to narrow down what we wanted to do.
If we were to do this sprint again, we would want to make sure we had a clear idea of who was responsible for what and when it was due.
Also making sure that every team member was going to be around for the duration of the project.
If we took these precautions, the project would have gone smoother.

We also think having hard set teams may have been a mistake. 
Team members should have felt responsible for the whole project, not just their part.
We should have assigned tasks to team members based on their strengths and weaknesses, not just their group.
We also should have allowed team members that where not familiar with a part of the project to work on it allowing them to learn and grow.
We did have some team members that where not familiar with the front-end or back-end, but they where not given the opportunity to work on it.
If we were to do this sprint again, we would want to make sure that every team member had the opportunity to work on every part of the project.
Though this would have slowed down the project, it would have made the team stronger and more knowledgeable.

### Sprint 2 (Emma Wright)

#### Summary

Sprint 2 was our first development sprint.
Because we set up the project repository and completed the design documents in the first sprint, we were able to start development right away.
Creating a Django project and a Vue project was the first step.
The front-end team worked on the user interface and the front-end components.
The backend team worked on the database and the back-end components.
The middleend team worked on connecting the front-end and back-end.

#### Goals

The goal for this sprint, being the first Development sprint, was to get all of our pseudocode and planning from the low-level documentation into actual code. 
As well as do a simple hookup with the server and frontend and get the signup, login, and welcome page looking pretty and successfully creating/logging in users. 
We also wanted a simple "homepage" for each kind of user to display that logging in had worked.

#### Accomplishments

The hookup was a success, we were able to run the project with both the front and backend hooked up from the start. This definitely helped streamline a lot of the work for the rest of the development sprints. A lot of the puesdocode written previously was also translated into code. This allowed backend to be able to help with debugging a lot faster as the frontend got built. A good example of this during this sprint was with signup and login. They didn't work fora bit but we were able to get both to succeed by the end of this sprint. It was one of our biggest hurdles and a great one to overcome.
The backend team was able to create the database and most of the back-end components.
The front-end team was learn how to use Vue and create some of the front-end components.
It took time to learn how to use Vue, and get templates set up, but we were able to get a good start on the front-end.

#### Setbacks

Vue is a weird language, and relearning Django takes some time. Everyone spent a lot of the sprint learning and reading documentation to make sure their implementations were following the language properly and that it wouldn't crash the server. 
Vue was new to most of the team, so it took time to learn how to use it.
Learning what the different parts of Vue were and how they worked together was challenging.

Django and the Django Rest Framework work together well but can be confusing at times.
It took time to learn how to use them together and how to set up the database.
It also took us time to learn about serializers and how to use them.

#### Lessons Learned

We learned a lot about Vite, Vue and Django running through this. With connecting, making calls to the backend, how to return json to the frontend, and proper routing names so nothing got confused between different calls and routes. 
The Django Rest framework has an awesome browsable API that makes it easy to test the back-end.

#### Retrospective

Overall I think the first development sprint went as smoothly as it did. We possibly could've prepared better with the frontend and connection if the low level design went better. But getting the frontend and backend connected from the start and figuring out signing up and logging in so quickly was a great way to start off development.
We felt this sprint was a success, but it was challenging to get the front-end and back-end set up.
It was confusing to figure out how to use Vue and Django together. 
Emma Wright was able to get the front-end set up and working with the back-end.

### Sprint 4 (Nate McKenzie)

#### Summary

This sprint was the final development. We all pulled together to try to get a cohesive app together. A lot of the frontend came together this sprint, while the backend was patched to match as new bugs became apparent.


#### Goals

The goal was to add as many missing features as possible. We priortized these ones:

|Task                   |Notes                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Dater Create Gig       |Create a frontend interface for the daters to create gigs.                             |
|Various navigation     |Navigating around was difficult and inconsistent, so had to be fixed                   |
|Dater View Feedback    |Create a page for dater's to view ratings they have been given                         |
|Cupid See Availabe Gigs|Create a page for cupid's to see gigs that are available for them.                     |
|Cupid Feedback         |Create interface for cupids to rate daters and see their own ratings                   |
|Dater Give Feedback    |Create page for daters to give feedback on Cupids                                      |
|Manager dashboard      |All of the manager frontend was included in this one                                   |
|Cupids see past jobs   |Was deemed low priority, but ended up as a convenient way for them to rate daters      |
|Cupid make money       |Allow cupids to actually make money from completed gigs                                |
|Calendar               |Create a page for daters to view and schedule dates                                    |
|Backend Unit Tests     |Wrote the lion's share of unit tests for the backend                                   |
|User manual            |Wrote the User manual                                                                  |
|Gigs show names, not id|Gigs were displaying id of cupid/dater on other end, now they show the names           |
|AI microphone listening|Allow the frontend to record audio from the microphone, then send the transcription to the AI|

#### Accomplishments
We succesfully completed the above tasks, except for the AI listening in to the microphone. This gave our frontend most of the core capabilities that were still lacking. Because of this our app was fully functional for the basic uses of Cupid Code.

#### Setbacks

The AI listening in on the microphone took a lot of our manhours and ended up going nowhere. This was a real shame and took resources that could have been used elsewhere. I think we all learned a lot from the experience, however.

We also had at least one major issue with git because one of our main directories was renamed from `Dev` to `Code`. As a part of this rename something happened with the gitignore which caused some files to be lost. In particular the files used by our dependencie managers got lost, resulting in the app being unable to run. We were able to fix it and get back on track.

#### Lessons Learned

Prioritizing tasks was pretty big in this sprint, as it was our last chance to finish everything up. The AI microphone was a high priority issue because we really wanted it to work, but we might have been able to do more by giving up on it earlier.

We learned to be careful messing with unimportant things with a deadline coming up. Luckily this one wasn't a big deal in the end, but it was not worth the hassle when we were already on a time crunch.

#### Retrospective

Overall, this sprint went really well. We were able to accomplish a lot of tasks and stay focused on our end goal. As we looked back at our design and requirements doc we felt that we had met the goals we had set there pretty well. Our team dynamic was pretty strong this sprint, and we all enjoyed working together on this project.

### Sprint 5 (Emma Wright)

#### Summary

This sprint was all about testing. 
We worked hard to get all of our tests written but it has been a struggle to get them to run.
Weirdly we had to deploy the project to get the tests to run. 
When we where able to get them to run we found that the structure of our unit tests was not great.

#### Goals

Finish testing on the backend and do some level of testing on the frontend were the primary goals for this sprint. 
Backend had begun writing unit tests during development and in between debugging the actual views they were writing tests for, so all that was left for them to do was to finalize all of those and potentially start some integration tests for better code coverage. 
Frontend wasn't able to start testing early, so our team spent this sprint setting up Selenium. 
The goal was to get some core coverage with the tool.

#### Accomplishments

All the tests got written, and Selenium actually was able to be ran. 
We also got a fun presentation setup for our final showing of the project to the whole class.
Writing the tests was a lot of work. 
We started early on the backend, but it was hard to get them to run.
We should have figured out how to run the tests before we started writing them.

#### Setbacks

Unit testing in Django is really weird and confusing. 
There are lots of great tools that make testing quick and easy but actually writing the code with those tools? 
The worst thing ever. 
Makes it even harder to figure out if the tests are failing because they're written wrong or because the views they're testing are wrong.

#### Lessons Learned

Don't write a bunch of unit tests with MagicMock without testing them first to make sure they're written right.
We had to refactor the code to make it easier to test. 
We learned that it is important to write tests as you go, not after the fact.

#### Retrospective

We felt this sprint was a success, but it was challenging to get the tests to run.
Tests are important and we all will make sure to keep them in the center of our development process in the future.
We also learned that it is important to write tests as you go, not after the fact.

### Sprint 6 (Eric Deboolis)

#### Summary

Each team member was given the task to add their sprint summaries for then they were the team lead of a given sprint. Some general editing of 
project documents was also done such as checking for gammar and spelling, updating documents with any changes that came about as the project 
was created, and acting on the feedback given on prior assignments. 

#### Goals

Finalize the the project, create a final report, and turn everything in. 

#### Accomplishments

We did just that. We all did a final review of the documents for the project and turned these documents in. The biggest thing that was created 
was this final report going over the project.
