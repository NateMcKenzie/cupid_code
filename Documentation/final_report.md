## Project Overview

The Dev Team had a lot of fun working on this project.
The team was able to create a fully functional dating app that allows users to create profiles, plan dates, and chat with the AI.
The team used Vue for the front-end, Django for the back-end, and SQLlite for the database. 
The team was able to implement all the features planned for the project, including user authentication, profile creation, and chat functionality. 
The team also implemented a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
Overall, the team is very proud of the work done on this project and is excited to share it with the world.

## Project Management

The project was managed using a Agile methodology. 
The team used the Scrum framework to organize the work into sprints.

### Sprint 1 (Nate Stott)

#### Summary

This Sprint was focused on getting the high and low level design documents completed.
We had three weeks to complete the design documents and we were able to get them done in time.
During this sprint we broke down the project into smaller tasks and assigned them to team members.
We also broke team members into smaller groups to work on specific parts of the project.
These smaller groups met regularly to discuss the progress of the project and to plan the work for the next sprint.
Groups included the front-end team, the back-end team, and the middleend team.
Someone being apart of a group did not mean that they could not work on other parts of the project.
In a lot of cases team members worked on multiple parts of the project in different groups.
Someone being assigned to a group just meant that they were responsible for that part of the project.
We also created a timeline for the project and set goals for each sprint.
Overall, this sprint was a success and we where excited to move on to the next sprint.

#### Goals

We had three goals for this sprint:
1. Complete the high level design document
2. Complete the low level design document
3. Create a timeline for the project

#### Accomplishments

We were able to complete all three goals for this sprint.
The high level design document was completed on time and was approved by the team.
The low level design document was also completed on time and was approved by the team.
We were also able to create a timeline for the project and set goals for each sprint.

#### Setbacks

We had to shift group members around to ensure every group had enough people to complete the tasks.

#### Lessons Learned

We learned that it is important to break the project down into smaller tasks.
This makes it easier to assign tasks to team members and to track the progress of the project.
It also allows parts of the project to be switched out for new ideas without affecting the whole project.
A high and low level design document are important to have before starting the project.

#### Retrospective

We felt this sprint was a success, but it was challenging to get the high and low level design documents done in time.
With so many ideas, and possible features, it was hard to narrow down what we wanted to do.
If we were, to do this sprint again, we would want to make sure we had a clear idea of who was responsible for what and when it was due.
Also making sure that every team member was going to be around for the duration of the project.
If we took these precautions, the project would have gone smoother.

We also think having hard set teams may have been a mistake. 
Team members should have felt responsible for the whole project, not just their part.
We should have assigned tasks to team members based on their strengths and weaknesses, not just their group.
We also should have allowed team members that where not familiar with a part of the project to work on it allowing them to learn and grow.
We did have some team members that where not familiar with the front-end or back-end, but they where not given the opportunity to work on it.
If we were to do this sprint again, we would want to make sure that every team member had the opportunity to work on every part of the project.
Though this would have slowed down the project, it would have made the team stronger and more knowledgeable.
