### Sprint 1 (Nate Stott)

#### Summary

We set up the project repository and started working on the high and low level design documents.
We had three weeks to complete the design documents, and we were able to get them done in time.
During this sprint, we broke down the project into smaller tasks and assigned them to team members.
We also broke team members into smaller groups to work on specific parts of the project.
These smaller groups met regularly to discuss the progress of the project and to plan the work for the next sprint.
Groups included the front-end team, the back-end team, and the middleend team.
Someone being a part of a group did not mean that they could not work on other parts of the project.
In a lot of cases, team members worked on multiple parts of the project in different groups.
Someone being assigned to a group just meant that they were responsible for that part of the project.
We also created a timeline for the project and set goals for each sprint.
Overall, this sprint was a success, and we were excited to move on to the next sprint.

- Group responsibilities
  - Front-end
    - Design the user interface
    - Create the front-end components
    - Implement the front-end functionality
  - Back-end
    - Design the database
    - Create the back-end components
    - Implement the back-end functionality
  - Middleend
    - Connect the front-end and back-end
    - Implement the middleend functionality

#### Goals

We had three goals for this sprint:
1. Complete the high-level design document
2. Complete the low-level design document
3. Create a timeline for the project

#### Accomplishments

We were able to complete all three goals for this sprint.
The high level design document was completed on time and was approved by the team.
The low level design document was also completed on time and was approved by the team.
We were also able to create a timeline for the project and set goals for each sprint.

#### Setbacks

We had to shift group members around to ensure every group had enough people to complete the tasks.

#### Lessons Learned

We learned that it is important to break the project down into smaller tasks.
This makes it easier to assign tasks to team members and to track the progress of the project.
It also allows parts of the project to be switched out for new ideas without affecting the whole project.
A high and low level design document are important to have before starting the project.

#### Retrospective

We felt this sprint was a success, but it was challenging to get the high and low level design documents done in time.
With so many ideas, and possible features, it was hard to narrow down what we wanted to do.
If we were, to do this sprint again, we would want to make sure we had a clear idea of who was responsible for what and when it was due.
Also making sure that every team member was going to be around for the duration of the project.
If we took these precautions, the project would have gone smoother.

We also think having hard set teams may have been a mistake. 
Team members should have felt responsible for the whole project, not just their part.
We should have assigned tasks to team members based on their strengths and weaknesses, not just their group.
We also should have allowed team members that where not familiar with a part of the project to work on it allowing them to learn and grow.
We did have some team members that where not familiar with the front-end or back-end, but they where not given the opportunity to work on it.
If we were to do this sprint again, we would want to make sure that every team member had the opportunity to work on every part of the project.
Though this would have slowed down the project, it would have made the team stronger and more knowledgeable.

### Sprint 2 (Emma Wright)

#### Summary

Sprint 2 was our first development sprint.
Because we set up the project repository and completed the design documents in the first sprint, we were able to start development right away.
Creating a Django project and a Vue project was the first step.
The front-end team worked on the user interface and the front-end components.
The backend team worked on the database and the back-end components.
The middleend team worked on connecting the front-end and back-end.

#### Goals

Get the project set up to the point where we could start hooking up the front-end and back-end in the next sprint.

#### Accomplishments

The backend team was able to create the database and most of the back-end components.
The front-end team was learn how to use Vue and create some of the front-end components.
It took time to learn how to use Vue, and get templates set up, but we were able to get a good start on the front-end.

#### Setbacks

Vue was new to most of the team, so it took time to learn how to use it.
Learning what the different parts of Vue were and how they worked together was challenging.

Django and the Django Rest Framework work together well but can be confusing at times.
It took time to learn how to use them together and how to set up the database.
It also took us time to learn about serializers and how to use them.

#### Lessons Learned

The Django Rest framework has an awesome browsable API that makes it easy to test the back-end.

#### Retrospective

We felt this sprint was a success, but it was challenging to get the front-end and back-end set up.
It was confusing to figure out how to use Vue and Django together. 
Emma Wright was able to get the front-end set up and working with the back-end.
