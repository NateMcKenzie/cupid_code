## Project Overview

The Dev Team had a lot of fun working on this project.
The team was able to create a fully functional dating app that allows users to create profiles, plan dates, and chat with the AI.
The team used Vue for the front-end, Django for the back-end, and SQLlite for the database. 
The team was able to implement all the features planned for the project, including user authentication, profile creation, and chat functionality. 
The team also implemented a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. 
Overall, the team is very proud of the work done on this project and is excited to share it with the world.

## Project Management

The project was managed using a Agile methodology. 
The team used the Scrum framework to organize the work into sprints. 
The team met regularly to discuss the progress of the project and to plan the work for the next sprint. 
The team used GitLab to track the progress of the project and to assign tasks to team members. 
The team also used Discord to communicate with each other and to share files and information.

### Sprint 2

#### Goals
The goal for this sprint, being the first Development sprint, was to get all of our psuedocode and planning from the low level documentation into actual code. As well as do simple hookup with the server and frontend and get the signup, login, and welcome page looking pretty and successfully creating/logging in users. We also wanted a simple "homepage" for each kind of user to display that logging in had worked.

#### Accomplishments
The hookup was a success, we were able to run the project with both the front and backend hooked up from the start. This definitely helped streamline a lot of the work for the rest of the development sprints. A lot of the puesdocode written previously was also translated into code. This allowed backend to be able to help with debugging a lot faster as the frontend got built. A good example of this during this sprint was with signup and login. They didn't work fora bit but we were able to get both to succeed by the end of this sprint. It was one of our biggest hurdles and a great one to overcome.

#### Setbacks
Vue is a weird language, and relearning Django takes some time. Everyone spent a lot of the sprint learning and reading documentation to make sure their implementations were following the language properly and that it wouldn't crash the server. 

#### Lessons Learned
We learned a lot about Vite, Vue and Django running through this. With connecting, making calls to the backend, how to return json to the frontend, and proper routing names so nothing got confused between different calls and routes. 

#### Retrospective
Overall I think the first development sprint went as smoothly as it did. We possibly could've prepared better with the frontend and connection if the low level design went better. But getting the frontend and backend connected from the start and figuring out signing up and logging in so quickly was a great way to start off development.

### Sprint 5

#### Goals
Finish testing on the backend and do some level of testing on the frontend were the primary goals for this sprint. Backend had began writing unit tests during development and in between debugging the actual views they were writing tests for, so all that was left for them to do was to finalize all of those and potentially start some integration tests for better code coverage. Frontend wasn't able to start testing early so our team spent this sprint setting up Selenium. The goal was to get some core coverage with the tool.

#### Accomplishments
All of the tests got written and Selenium actually was able to be ran. We also got a fun presentation setup for our final showing of the project to the whole class.

#### Setbacks
Unit testing in Django is really weird and confusing. There's lots of great tools that make testing quick and easy but actually writing the code with those tools? The worst thing ever. Makes it even harder to figure out if the tests are failing because they're written wrong or because the views they're testing are wrong.

#### Lessons Learned
Don't write a bunch of unit tests with MagicMock without testing them first to make sure they're written right.
